# Assembly

When you get your Compute Blade, the box will include:
- Compute Blade
- Latch Lever
- Latch Anchor
- x2 M3x6 Screws
- M2x2.5 Screw
- M2x2.5 Standoff
- M2 Nylon Washer

## Out of  the Box

Removing the Blade from the box it will be wrapped in bubble wrap. The Latch and other hardware will be a separate bag in the box

From the factory the Blade will have Kapton tape on the all of the threaded mounting points and the DIP Switches(If dev model). Remove the the tape.

## Latch

The latch comes in two parts 

<img src="/img/blade/latch-parts.png" alt="Parts for compute blade latch" width={'70%'}/>

To assemble the two parts place the "lever" with the flat side down. Then place the "Anchor" with the two mounting holes facing the table as showing the Image above.
Next press firmly until the pieces snap together.

:::warning
Be sure to assemble the two parts correctly it is difficult to separate them and can damage the latch

Witch the Latch assembled it can be secured to a the blade. Using a PH1 screw driver take the two M3x6 screws and secure the latch to the blade

The latch is now assembled and attached to the Compute Blade

## M.2 Slot

The Compute Blade has 1 M.2 M key slot for expansion. Which supports devices from `2230` to `22110`.

To use the slot screw the included M2x2.5 standoff using a 5mm hex driver into the thread insert corresponding to the size of your M.2 device.

:::tip
If Installing and NVMe SSD you may want to install and Operating system first. See our [Imaging guide](/blade/getting-started/image?boot=ssd)
:::

Place the M2 nylon washer on the M2x2.5 screw and insert the M.2 device at a 30° angle.

Finally using a PH1 driver secure to the standoff the M2x2.5 screw with the M2 nylon washer on it.

The M.2 Device is now installed.

## Compute module

The Compute Blade is built for the Raspberry Pi Compute Module 4(CM4). 

:::warning
Compute Blade is Made for the CM4 other compute module may **NOT** work as intended on the Compute Blade as they are not officially validated
:::

<img src="/img/blade/mk4-k-cm4.png" alt="Blade with cm4 above" width={'70%'}/>

Align the CM4 board to board connecter with the Compute Blade

<img src="/img/blade/mk4-k-cm4-aligned.png" alt="Blade with cm4 above and flipped over showing board to board connecter" width={'70%'}/>

Then place the CM4 onto the connector and press firmly.

<img src="/img/blade/mk4-k-cm4-installed.png" alt="Blade with CM4 installed" width={'70%'}/>

## Heat Sink (Optional)

A heat sink is recommend to get the most out of your CM4. The Compute Blade Heat sink is built to give your Compute Blade the best performance.

Included in the box
- Heat Sink
- x4 M2.5x8 Screws
- Extra Thermal Pads

<img src="/img/blade/mk4-k-hs-parts.png" alt="Compute blade with Heat Sink parts" width={'70%'}/>


:::warning
To install the Heat Sink a Compute Module 4 must be installed First
:::
 
 Remove the plastic  from the pre-applied thermal pads.

<img src="/img/blade/mk4-k-hs-thermal.png" alt="Heat Sink with thermal pads highlighted" width={'70%'}/>

The place the heat sink on to the CM4. The text on the edge of the heat sink should be at the top of the blade.
The Heat sink can now be secured with the four included M2.5x8 screws. Using a PH1 screw driver tighten the screw to secure the heat sink.

:::warning
    Do not over tighten the screws. Over tightening the Compute Blade to bend.

The Heat Sink is now fully installed
