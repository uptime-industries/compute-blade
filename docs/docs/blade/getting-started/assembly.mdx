# Assembly

When you get your Compute Blade, the box will include:
- Compute Blade
- Latch Lever
- Latch Anchor
- x2 M3x6 Screws
- M2x2.5 Screw
- M2x2.5 Standoff
- M2 Nylon Washer

## Out of  the Box

Removing the Blade from the box it will be wrapped in bubble wrap. The Latch and other hardware will be a separate bag in the box.

From the factory the Blade will have Kapton tape on the all of the threaded mounting points and the DIP Switches(if dev model). Remove the tape.

## Latch

The latch comes in two parts:

<img src="/img/blade/latch-parts.webp" alt="Parts for compute blade latch" width={'70%'}/>

To assemble the two parts place the "lever" with the flat side down, then place the "Anchor" with the two mounting holes facing the table as shown in the image above.
Next press firmly until the pieces snap together.

:::warning
Be sure to assemble the two parts correctly; it is difficult to separate them and can damage the latch.
:::

With the Latch assembled it can be secured to the blade. Using a PH1 screw driver, take the two M3x6 screws and secure the latch to the blade.

The latch is now assembled and attached to the Compute Blade.

## M.2 Slot

The Compute Blade has 1 M.2 M key slot for expansion, which supports devices from `2230` to `22110`. This slot can be used to for Storage, hardware accelerator, or even a GPU. 

:::tip
If you are unsure about which threaded insert to put the standoff in check the [M.2 Slot](/blade/guide/m.2) page
:::

<img src="/img/blade/mk4-k-m2.webp" alt="MK4-k Blade with parts and Samsung SSD 980" width={'70%'}/>

To use the slot, screw the included M2x2.5 standoff into the threaded insert corresponding to the size of your M.2 device using a 5mm hex driver. In the bellow picture shows a Samsung SSD 980 which is a `2280` M.2 M key device.

:::tip
If installing an NVMe SSD, you may want to install an Operating system first. See our [imaging guide](/blade/getting-started/image?boot=ssd)
:::

Place the M2 nylon washer on the M2x2.5 screw and insert the M.2 device at a 30° angle.

<img src="/img/blade/mk4-k-m2-placed.webp" alt="MK4-K blade with Samsung SSD 980 placed" width={'70%'}/>

Finally, using a PH1 driver secure the M2x2.5 screw with the M2 nylon washer to the standoff.

The M.2 device is now installed.

## Compute Module

The Compute Blade is built for the Raspberry Pi Compute Module 4(CM4). 

:::warning
The Compute Blade is made for the CM4; other compute modules may **NOT** work as intended on the Compute Blade as they are not officially validated.
:::

<img src="/img/blade/mk4-k-cm4.webp" alt="Blade with cm4 above" width={'70%'}/>

Align the CM4 board to board connecter with the Compute Blade.

<img src="/img/blade/mk4-k-cm4-aligned.webp" alt="Blade with cm4 above and flipped over showing board to board connecter" width={'70%'}/>

Place the CM4 onto the connector and press firmly.

<img src="/img/blade/mk4-k-cm4-installed.webp" alt="Blade with CM4 installed" width={'70%'}/>

## Heat Sink

A heat sink is recommend to get the most out of your CM4. The Compute Blade Heat Sink is built to give your Compute Blade the best performance.

Included in the box
- Heat Sink
- x4 M2.5x8 Screws
- Extra Thermal Pads

<img src="/img/blade/mk4-k-hs-parts.webp" alt="Compute Blade with Heat Sink parts" width={'70%'}/>


:::warning
To install the Heat Sink a Compute Module 4 must be installed first
:::
 
 Remove the plastic from the pre-applied thermal pads.

<img src="/img/blade/mk4-k-hs-thermal.webp" alt="Heat Sink with thermal pads highlighted" width={'70%'}/>

Place the heat sink on to the CM4. The text on the edge of the heat sink should be at the top of the blade.
The Heat sink can now be secured with the four included M2.5x8 screws. Using a PH1 screw driver, tighten the screws to secure the heat sink.

:::warning
Do not over tighten the screws. Over tightening will cause the Compute Blade to bend.
:::

<img src="/img/blade/mk4-k-hs-assembled.webp" alt="Blade with Heat Sink attached" width={'70%'}/>

The Heat Sink is now fully installed.
