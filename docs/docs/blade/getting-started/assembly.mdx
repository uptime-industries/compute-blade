# Assembly

Out of the box the Compute blade has some assembly required.

First, remove all for the yellow kapton tape from the blade.

## Latch

The latch comes in two parts 

{/* show the two parts */}

To addeblet thes two parts place the "lever" with the flat side down. The place the secound piece with the two mounting holes facing the table and press firmly until the peaces snap together.

Using a PH1 srew driver take the two M3x6 screws and secure the latch to the blade

The latch is now assembled and atached to the Compute Blade

## Compute module

The Compute Blade is build to support the Rassberry Pi Compute Module 4(CM4). 

:::warning
    Compute Blade is Made for the CM4 other compute module may **NOT** work as intended on the Compute Blade as they are not officially tested
:::

Align the CM4 board to board connecter with the Compute Blade

Then Press frimly until the CM4 is fully seated in the connecter.

## Heat Sink (Optional)

A heat sink is recomened to get the most out of your CM4. The Compute Blade Heat sink is built to give your Compute Blade the best preformace.
To install your heat sink your CM4 must be installed first see the above instructions if you need help. With the CM4 installed remove the plasict from the pre-applied thermal pads.

The place the heat sink on to the CM4. The text on the edge of the heat sink should be at the top of the blade.

The Heat sink can now be secured with the four included M2.5x8 screws. Using a PH1 screw driver tighten the screw to secure the heat sink.

:::warning
    Do not over tighten the screws. Over tightening the Compute Blade to bend.

The Heat Sink is now fully installed

## Fan Unit (Optional)

Fan units will come in four parts
- Fan Unit board
- Left Bracket
- Right Bracket
- 5V Fan

:::note
The Fan Unit is designed for a 5V fan like the Noctua [NF-A4x20 5V PWM](https://noctua.at/en/products/fan/nf-a4x20-5v-pwm)
:::

![Fan Unit parts](/img/fan-unit/dumb-parts.png)

Start by installing the Brackets onto the Fan. The Bradis are toolless and wil snap right on

![Two fans with Bkractest installed](/img/fan-unit/brackets.png)

Next intsall the fan into the Fan Unit Baord. 

![Fan installed onto fan unit board](/img/fan-unit/fan.png)

Finaly, connect the Fan to the 4-pin fan header on the fan unit board

### Conecting to Compute Blade

:::info
    The Fan Units are designed to work out with the [Blade Runner™️](/blade-runner) enclosers
:::

When conecting the blade to the Fan Unit the the borids should be 90° relitive to each other
No addtional work is need to make the Fan unit run.
