# Imaging Storage Media

You can boot the Raspberry Pi Compute Module 4 (CM4) in several ways on the Compute Blade

:::note
Pre-boot eXecution Environment(PXE) is a process to boot a computer over the a network. It will not be covered here. Aee our [dedicated guide](/blade/advanced-guides/pxe-booting/) for more information
:::

## Prepare Storage Media

To prepare a storage media you will need another computer.

<Tabs groupId="boot" defaultValue="ssd">
    <TabItem value="microsd" label="microSD Card" >
        <Admonition type="warning">
            Only the Dev model Compute Blade has a microSD Card slot
        </Admonition>
        <Admonition type="note">
            CM4s with part number `CM4XXX000` must be used as others have eMMC and are unable to use MicroSD Card slot
            <img src='/img/cm4-box.webp' width="250" alt='CM4 box with model number highlighted'/>
        </Admonition>
        The microSD Card needs to be at least 8GB. Your computer may not have a microSD Card slot and need an adapter.
    </TabItem>
    <TabItem value="ssd" label="SSD">
        <Admonition type="warning">
            The Compute Blade supports M key and B+M key M.2 devices, from size `2230` to `22110`
        </Admonition>
        The Compute Blade has a M.2 M key witch supports both SATA and NVMe Solid State Drives(SSD).
        The M.2 SSD can be imaged the same as the microSD card but requires an USB to M.2 NVME/SATA Adapter, such as the [UGREEN M.2 NVMe SSD Enclosure Adapter](https://www.ugreen.com/collections/hard-drive-enclosure/products/ugreen-m-2-nvme-ssd-enclosure-adapter?variant=39915665195070).
    </TabItem>
    <TabItem value="emmc" label="eMMC">
        <Admonition type="warning">
            eMMC can only be imaged on Dev blade as it has USB-C port, USB switch, and `nRPIBOOT` button
        </Admonition>
        <Admonition type="note">
            CM4s with part number `CM4XXX000` do **NOT** have eMMC and are referred to as lite.

            <img src='/img/cm4-box.webp' width="250" alt='CM4 box with model number highlighted'/>
        </Admonition>
        Install [usbboot](/blade/advanced-guides/usbboot)
        From the usbboot directory run
        ```bash
        sudo ./rpiboot
        ```

        Move the USB switch to the USB-C position.
        Then, while holding down the `nRPIBOOT` button on the blade connect the USB-C cable.

        ![Compute Blade with USB and nRPIBOOT button highlighted](/img/blade/mk4-k-nRPIBOOT.webp)

        The Device will reconnect several times. On the last time it will appear as a USB media device.
    </TabItem>
</Tabs>

Download and install [Raspberry Pi Imager](https://www.raspberrypi.com/software/). After installing run it. This software will be used to image the storage media.

![Raspberry Pi Imager Home](/img/imager/Imager-Home.webp)

Select Raspberry Pi 4

![Raspberry Pi Imager Device Filter](/img/imager/imager-device.webp)

Select an operating system. We recommend Ubuntu Server 24.04 LTS (64-bit) `Operating System > Other general-purpose OS > Ubuntu > Ubuntu Server 24.04 LTS (64-bit)`

![Raspberry Pi Imager OS](/img/imager/imager-os.webp)

Select storage media

![Raspberry Pi Imager storage](/img/imager/imager-storage.webp)

Click the `NEXT` then click the `EDIT SETTINGS` button. Two settings need to be edited.

- `GENERAL > Set hostname` - This name will be used to connect to your blade later
- `GENERAL > Set username and password` - Use your own username and password
- `GENERAL > Set locale setting`(Optional) - Set the blade locale setting 

![Raspberry Pi Imager setting general](/img/imager/imager-setting-general.webp)

`SERVICES > Enable SSH` - Use password authentication
<Admonition type="info">
    `Allow public-key authentication only` is the more secure option, but is more complex to set up. Read more in our [SSH guide](/blade/getting-started/connect/#public-key-authentication)
</Admonition>

![Raspberry Pi Imager setting service](/img/imager/imager-setting-service.webp)

Then click `SAVE`

Finally click `YES` and confirm that all existing data on the storage device will be erased by clicking `YES` again.
Raspberry Pi Imager will begin to write the OS to the storage device.

Once completed remove the storage device from the computer

## Install Storage Media in Blade

<Tabs groupId="boot" defaultValue="ssd" queryString="boot">
    <TabItem value="microsd" label="microSD Card" >
        <Admonition type="warning">
            Only the Dev model Compute Blade has a microSD Card Slot.
        </Admonition>
        Next to the top right corner of the CM4 you will find the microSD card slot. Insert the card with the pins facing down.

    <TabItem value="ssd" label="SSD">
        1. Remove the Kapton tape from the standoff mount
        2. Using a 5mm hex driver, attach the standoff
        3. Insert the M.2 SSD at a 30° angle and press down
        4. Place the M2 nylon washer on and use a PH1 driver to retain the M.2 SSD

    <TabItem value="emmc" label="eMMC">
        Unplug the USB-C cable from the Compute Blade and set the switch to USB-A
