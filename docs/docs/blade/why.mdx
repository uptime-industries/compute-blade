# Why Compute Blade?

ComputeBlade platform are designed to streamline complex processes, turning what was once a daunting task into a manageable and efficient experience.  

ComputeBlade in combination with BladeRunner enclosure, Fan Unit and Heatsink opens unlimited creative spaces for infrastructure use cases and project scaling. Designed to work 24/7. Developed by listening and understanding the desires of real users. By a real user. Tested in a real production environment. The first prototypes already have more than two years of continuous operation. 

The ComputeBlade is specifically designed to allow you to run the Raspberry Pi CM4 / CM5 at at least 2GHz Increased power and peak power supply power up to 30W with PoE+ 

Compute Blade realized in three different versions to enable a scalable and feature-rich cluster platform as easily as possible:

- With the **Dev version**, you have all the possibilities, which often serves as the master node.
- With the **TPM version**, you can add additional security features like secure boot to your cluster environment, if needed.
- With Basic version scale your cluster project  environments with a low-budget approach.

# Use Cases

To provide all the flexibility and options your project needs, we included different extension ports in the blade design, which can be used for accessories and expansion modules. Our M.2 port serves as a connection for all our high-speed uptime modules, in addition to your NVMe drives. 

Besides feature extension modules, we aim to make the compute cluster experience as effortless as possible. Therefore, we've added additional accessories like enclosures to give the blades a home for all kinds of projects. We also offer different colored heat sinks to easily identify the blades, in addition to the customizable LED function. More enhancements are in the works which will extend your Compute Blade platform.
