### Connecting to Compute Blade
:::info
    The Fan Units are only designed to work with the [BladeRunner™™️](/bladerunner) enclosures
:::

When connecting the blade to the Fan Unit the boards should be 90° relative to each other. They use a square 4-pin connector and it is possible to connect them incorrectly out side of a BladeRunner enclosure. To avoid this please only connect the Fan Unit to the Compute Blade in a BladeRUnner Enclosure

:::danger
    Plugging the Compute Blade into the Fan Unit incorrectly may lead to permanent damage to the Fan Unit, Blade any device installed on the Blade.
